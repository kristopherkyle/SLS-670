## Welcome to SLS 670: Quantitative Research Methods for Second Language Research

This site will include tutorials for performing all quantitative analyses (in R/Rstudio) for the course.

This site will NOT be a substitute for the more technical and conceptual aspects of quantitative research methods (which are covered in assigned readings).

This site WILL show you how to do each analysis in R (and provide a small amount of commentary).
